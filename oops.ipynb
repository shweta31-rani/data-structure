        "Ans:Python has a set of built-in methods and __call__ is one of them. The __call__ method enables Python programmers to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function. When this method is defined, calling an object (obj(arg1, arg2)) automatically triggers obj.__call__(arg1, arg2). This makes objects behave like functions, enabling more flexible and reusable code."
